    <div class="w-3/4">
        It’s been a while since I’ve been here. I only remember fragments of my past life—the smiles, the laughter, the warmth. The hot chocolate with marshmallows and peppermint, and the perfect hint of cinnamon, on icy days, and sticky, strawberry-red popsicles on sweltering days. The big Thanksgiving feasts during the last trickle of November. Jumping into the piles of maroon-red leaves, only to rake them up again, piling them higher and higher. The days of sledding, from morning to evening, down the steep hill across the street. 
        <div class="pt-7"> </div>
        Yes, I remember it here.
        <div class="pt-7"> </div>
Now, as I drift along the neat little rows of houses, I remember when I was once with the people there, all the years of yard sales and Halloween costume parades and shoveling snow together. It is winter now, yet the snow has not begun to fall. The people are dressed in thick coats and warm hats and fuzzy gloves. Little puffs of air like small clouds accompany their breaths. I remember being bundled up, when I was younger, in layers and layers of coats, to ward off the cold. But now, I don’t feel the cold at all, even though I only have a thin sweater. Some families are raking leaves, while others sit and smile at each other on their doorsteps, drinking warm cups of freshly-brewed coffee. I smile and wave at them, but they don’t wave back.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
They don’t even look at me.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
Near the rows of the houses, a tall brick building, the filmy watercolor red bleeding away from the bricks, greets me gloomily. As I move closer, I see that the doors are boarded over with wood planks filled with slivers, and the flourishing tree that once stood proudly in front of the doors was now reduced to a small stump. I remember my teacher, her treasured purple pen with the silver metallic barrel. Her hand-drawn posters plastered everywhere in the classroom, with encouraging quotes written wildly in fat purple marker. When we turned in our essays, we would get them back covered with scribbled notes written in purple. I smile to myself, thinking of how now, whenever I write something, I hear my teacher’s voice in my head, guiding me through her notes.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
I sigh as I move on, to a little park, the green broken bottle near the dull bluish trash can, the neatly-trimmed trees along the edges of the park, the mounds of tiny pebbles, sparkling like
gems in the dust. I remember running to the swingset as a child, and climbing onto one of the swings, begging my big brother to push me. I look back to the swingset, the cracks in the plasticky-leather seats, the chains rusted and old, creaking with every breath of the wind.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
And across from the swingset, I see a bubbling brook, weaving and sparkling in the sun. I remember that I used to stand in the brook during the summer, when the water was cool, but not ice cold, and little translucent minnows swam with the current. I remember that I would stand in the creek and watch the water pile up in front of me, before it wormed its way behind me. I feel an impulse, now, to step in the creek and feel the water tease and splash my feet. But, when I step in the brook, the water merely weaves along, as if it, too, doesn’t care that I exist.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
When I step out of the brook I feel myself drawn to a little path near the park, pale and bare. Slowly, I glide along the path, past the glossy needles of the evergreen trees, past the dying grass, next to the people walking together. I float down the path, wondering where I am going.
I take turn after turn, until I see it.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
A small house; the doorstep is cracked, and the walls choked with ivy. A sea of cream colored residue and scabs of yellow paint remain from the memories of when the house was once a proud yellow. The grass around the house has grown tall and brown and dying, the flowers in the garden have faded from pink to colorless, like an old photo of a memory, abandoned and forgotten. 
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
And as I look through the dusty windows, I see my mother sitting at the dining room table, silvery blonde hair dipping over her eyes, her spindly fingers clasped in her lap. Squinting through the window, through the years of dust and dirt, I look hard, hoping to see her smile—but her face is pallid and dark, and her mouth is thin and hardened, as if she hadn’t smiled in years. I drift to the door, which was once a gleaming red. Now, the paint is chipped, and the color has gone over the years.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
I raise my fist to knock on the door, but when I knock on the door, my hand sinks through, like a knife through melting butter. Slowly, as if pulled by an invisible force, I step through the door, like it is only a shaft of air, and I glide to the faded blue dining room.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“...Mom?”
<div class="pt-7"> </div> 
She doesn’t look up, and when I try to touch her shoulder, my hand passes right through her body. Quickly, I withdraw my hand, with a sickening sensation in my stomach. Why doesn’t she hear me? Why won’t she even look at me?
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“Mom!” I say, louder. 
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
She doesn’t turn, and I want to shake her, anything to make her turn, and see me, and hear me. Desperate, I flit through the dining table to face her. I look into her dull gray eyes, and see that their light, like an extinguished candle, has disappeared over the years. My mouth feels suddenly dry, and my hands tremble in rhythm to my racing heartbeat. What is happening? Why doesn’t anyone see me?
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
Suddenly, I wake up with a yelp. I turn to look at my desk, where my computer is waiting, nearly buried beneath mountains of files and papers, and I remember that I haven’t been home in a while. I think back to the years I spent at work, the nonstop projects, calls and interviews, the years of flying from country to country on countless business trips. 
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
I grab my phone from my nightstand, and checking it, I see four missed calls from my mother, and more messages, asking me to join her for Thanksgiving dinner. With a sudden jolt, I remember I didn’t come to the last Thanksgiving, either, and the one before, and the one before, and the one before—well, I don’t really remember. 
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
With a sigh, I glance back at the mountain of work on my desk and get out of bed. I pull a suitcase from my closet and begin to pack it with clothes.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
I’m going home.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
</div>
