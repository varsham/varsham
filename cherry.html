    <div class="w-3/4">
        The moon through the trees painted the yard in silver stripes, illuminating the patches of yellowed grass and winding thistles. Frost had begun to line the cracks of the browning leaves, and the apples had begun to fall from the fruit-heavy trees. They would thud against the ground with a slight crunch, as if knowing that this was their end.
        <div class="pt-7"> </div>
Cherry settled on the porch of the house, a blanket wrapped around her thin shoulders. She could almost see Claire walking out on the grass stiffened by glistening frost, laughing at the satisfying crunch the grass made against her woolen socks. Claire was never cold. She’d run outside in denim shorts and a cotton short-sleeve shirt in forty degree weather, and laugh at Cherry, who’d bundle herself in heavy parkas and thermal sweatpants and still shiver. She'd pick up snow in her bare hands, watching it melt and pour off of her thin palms. Claire loved winter.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
The house’s windows glowed with heavy amber light. Cherry could hear the murmur of people speaking, and the occasional clink of champagne glasses accompanied with raucous bouts of laughter. From where she was, she couldn’t see any of the people—the back door that led to the porch was covered with blinds on the inside—but if she leaned over, she could see the line of cars, like a funeral procession, along the street in front of the house. The sky was a deep black that swallowed all of the light in the air. Compared to the stubborn shine of the stars, the house’s lights seemed insignificant, just another pinprick in the unforgiving darkness. Cherry was just another girl sitting on her back porch, staring up at the night sky.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
She heard a tap at the door. Carefully, she stepped into her ruby red heels and walked around the house to the front. Stepping inside and opening the door slowly to soften its creaking cries, Cherry shook off some of the dirt on her shoes and made her way to the kitchen.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
The room was a cacophony of sound and light. The dusty chandelier swung precariously, one of the light bulbs flickering as an exceptionally tall woman brushed it with a dramatic flourish of her hand, caught up in her conversation. Cherry’s ankles ached. She’d asked her mother to let her wear her flats, but she’d insisted that Cherry wear the heels instead. Just as Cherry was about to turn and leave, she heard someone calling.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“Ah! Mary!” her mother, Anita, made her way through the crowd, every movement like a dance. 
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
Cherry’s mother moved like a feather blowing through the wind. Her voice was always breathless, as if she’d just run a race and received shocking news. Her eyes were dark circles that flickered weakly like candles. Cherry sometimes felt that she was the only one keeping the candles alive.
She turned around, the bobby pins of her hair digging into her skin as another suit-clad man brushed by her. “Mary, I was looking for you! I thought you’d be on the back porch.”
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“Can I go? Please?” Cherry asked.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
Her cheeks flamed; she didn’t want to be asking her mother for something so trivial. But they both knew that even though Cherry was nearly of the age to move out, Anita was the one who’d make the decisions.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“What were you doing there?” Anita had always been good at deflecting questions. Claire, she almost replied, but caught herself. Though her mother could read her easily, it felt forbidden to speak Claire’s name.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
Anita smiled, her unnaturally white teeth glinting in the light. “Please. Talk to the guests, mingle a little, Mary.”
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“It’s Cherry.” Cherry muttered, half-hoping Anita would hear. And she did, of course. But Anita only opened her mouth to speak, but thought better of it and said nothing.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
Claire had liked to make fun of Cherry for her cheeks turning cherry red in the winter, and her nickname soon became Cherry. Her mother hadn’t been too fond of it, but she'd only gotten less fond of it after the accident.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
"I'm leaving." Cherry said, pointlessly, since Anita was already turning away to start an overly enthusiastic conversation with one of the guests.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
But her voice was drowned in the laughter and constant murmur of speech and the forks of people helping themselves to peach pie clinking against the porcelain plates.A part of her wanted to shout, scream until her voice shattered. But she only bent under the crowd and walked out of the kitchen, her heels clicking on the floor. She climbed the stairs to where the balcony was, hoping to get some peace and quiet. But there were still guests crawling around upstairs. They hardly paid any attention to her, but she could still feel their stares on her back. She knew what they were thinking. She was the outcast, the odd one of Anita Walker's daughters. She knew they were thinking about what a shame it was, that Anita had lost such a beautiful daughter, and was left with one like Cherry. What a shame, what a shame.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
She balanced on the edge of the short railing of the balcony, feeling her heels quiver and threaten to fall off. Claire liked to stand here, and Cherry never realized why until she was gone. Anita always told both her daughters not to stand there, but Cherry liked the precarious feeling like a rollercoaster, the thrilling nervousness that hung in a perfect balance. She used to hold hands with Claire while they both stood on the railing, Claire laughing at Cherry while Cherry gaped in fear.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
A slight brush of air graced her calves. It was a burly gentleman, holding a cup of tea.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
“Careful, child,” he warned as he lumbered on.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
From the artistic layer of leaves that tinted the broth of the tea a pale green, Cherry knew it was green tea. Claire had loved green tea, but Cherry never understood how anyone could like it—it was practically plant-flavored water.
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
But then she suddenly remembered something Claire had once said. "It's in the subtleties, Cherry," she'd say. "Subtleties."
<div class="pt-7"> </div>
But then she felt the sudden, startling drop in her stomach as her balance shifted. Like a feather, she drifted forward, the red heels clattering back on the balcony, where safety was. She flew, the ground approaching, and as she opened her mouth to cry out in fear she realized there was no time. There had never been enough time.
